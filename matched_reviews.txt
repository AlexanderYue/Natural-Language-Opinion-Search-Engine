The picture quality is simply amazing, once the picture settings are tuned correctly. The default settings that come with the various picture modes are quite bad. I was initially worried that I might have a defective unit. The colors were just way off. Fortunately I found professional calibration results for this model on the Web [...]. If you're not happy with the color reproduction of this model, I strongly suggest that you give these settings a try.

The picture quality on this TV is outstanding. Whether we watch TV, stream movies via Netflix, blu-ray, or view home photos through our home network, the picture looks great.  SD, HD, & 3D all look crystal clear. You will be impressed with the quality and the TV looks very slim on the TV stand or wall.

I bought this book about 6 months ago and it has become a "bible" of sharpening for me.  I shot with 6mp and 8mp (now 10mp) dSLRS and had previously used a single pass of UnSharp Mask or Smart Sharpen for sharpening.  (all digital photos need sharpening -- *all* of them -- and in-camera sharpening is not desirable for many reasons)

My photos never came out as sharp as others I had seen published and I kept asking myself, "what am I doing wrong?!  Is it my equipment, my photo technique, ...?".  Now I know that at least part of it was my *sharpening* technique.  Also, I needed to learn that photos properly sharpened for output (printing) will likely *not* look good on the screen (esp at 100%), and how to better judge output sharpness when viewing on the screen.  Hints: (1) don't get freaked by apparent sharpening ugliness when viewing at 100% or greater; (2) only view at even zoom factors like 25% and 50%; and (3) 50% is often a fair zoom to use when judging sharpening for output.

The results I've seen from the sharpening techniques in this book range from "great" to "oh-my-god-this-is-*fabulous*".  I'm finally producing photos that are as sharp as I had always hoped for, comparable to anything I've seen published.

Bruce Fraser starts at the beginning, explaining the need for sharpening, and proceeds to build a case for why a three-level sharpening process is so effective (Source Sharpening, Content/Creative Sharpening, and Output Sharpening).  After you're convinced by his sound reasoning that this is a good idea, he details *how* to implement this 3-pass sharpening process.  I codified the three passes into Photoshop Actions, which now take no more time for me to run than the single-pass sharpening I had previously done.

I keep this book in my car or on my shelf, with dozens of post-it tags sticking out where I added my own indexing to all the good parts.  I'm sure that this book will become ragged with use, over the years.  It is without a doubt the most useful photography book I've bought in the last 10 years.

This is one outstanding camera.  Takes sharp, color-rich pictures.  Delivery was on time.

I like the camera very much.  The other cameras compared to it may be sharper but they don't have all the features this has. The picture quality is alright for me and the many settings are all very good. I like it very much.

[R3I3TFKLEAU38S]
Very sharp and crystal clear images! easy to set up! and very user friendly!

[R3JZDEAF206VEB]
This is a great camera.  Takes great pictures.  Picture to picture delay is short.  Images are very sharp because of the IS.

I received this TV yesterday to replace a Maxent LCD TV and I have say that the image quality is amazing. The size of the screen is just right for the living room of my apartment. I have separate speakers so I cannot comment on the sound. But picture quality is better than my Maxent by a big margin. Image is brighter and has a lot more definition. Menu is also easy to use.

I found 3 stuck pixels on the screen, but from 5 feet away, they have absolutely no impact on the picture quality.

The friends with whom I talk via Skype tell me that my pictue they see is very sharp and clear. They are the people who praised this web cam. They are the people who evaluated this webcam for me.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LVZO92/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/178-6065452-0104922">Logitech 720p Webcam C510</a>

The picture quality seems to be very good.  I can't tell for certain, since I don't know what the other end sees exactly, but they tell me it's fine.  Really, these web cams have a long way to go, but from what I can tell this inexpensive camera is as good as any other.
