Something interesting I encountered with the click problem, is there is also reviews with "click issue". I do not know if this was supposed to be addressed in the code, but I added it anyways
method 2 utilizes BERT. The way the transformer works is it finds reviews thatre similiar/equivalent to what were looking for. For instance, click problem returns these:
('R3MY3IUI0D9D97', 'B000H51GA6', 'A2YQL8DH5AKIGV', 7, 7, 1, 'Bad quality and questionable compatibility with Macs', '2009-11-27', 'bsptc', 'Logitech 3-Button USB Optical Wheel Mouse - Black (Personal Computers)', 'I bought this mouse about 6 months ago and recently the right mouse button became stuck and doesn\'t click at all. Also, after switching the mouse on my Mac with this Logitech, I noticed it started to act buggy and upon googling the specific problems that were happening, all signs pointed to the mouse. I almost always buy Logitech mice and am usually very happy with them with the exception of this mouse. My advice is to purchase a more durable model especially if you will use it on a Mac.', 0, 1, 0),
('RXFQY9BIHFWX7', 'B0000AOWWY', 'AYYAWL7LZYD5S', 1, 1, 2, 'Bad mouse response', '2005-08-07', 'Alexander I. Mcphail', 'Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop Elite (Personal Computers)', 'After using this product for about three weeks I am pretty sick of it.  While the keyboard is nice, the mouse is what drives me crazy.  The left-click button only works about half the time I click it.  Considering the left-click is the primary interface with a computer it needs to be reliable.  I WOULD NOT get this if I were you.  I am ready to throw the mouse against the wall.  If I still had the box I would return it.', 0, 0, 0),

These reviews, while not explicitly mentioning "Click problem", all are reviews in which there is a problem with the clicking. Whereas with boolean and method1 we only return reviews that have words inside the defined corpus of "positive_words" and "negative_words"
